# RFC Definition

[RFCs](https://www.ietf.org/process/rfcs/) (**R**equests **f**or **C**omments) are internet documents which
mediate the promotion of [IETF's](../ietf/definition.md) standards. An essential sample of such a
document is ["HTTP Semantics"](../http-rfc/9110.md). This project extensively
uses the document as a sort of algorithmical roadmap.
