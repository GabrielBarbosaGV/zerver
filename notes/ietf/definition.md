# IETF Definition

[The IETF](https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/) (*I*nternet *E*ngineering *T*ask *F*orce) is a 1986
founded standards development organization (SDO). The voluntary standards it promotes have been a cornerstone
of the internet since the organization's inception, and known to nearly all information technology professionals.
Examples of such standards are the [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc793.txt),
[User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc768), [network
routing algorithms](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1058) and, perhaps most famously of all,
[Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html). Despite its
importance, it does not control or patrol the functioning of internet.
